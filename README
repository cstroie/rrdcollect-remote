NAME
       rrdcollect-remote - Collect rrdcollect output from several
       hosts to update local RRD files.

SYNOPSIS
       rrdcollect-remote [-MFh] [-c config] [-l logconfig]

DESCRIPTION
       I discovered a nice tool called rrdcollect
       <http://rrdcollect.sourceforge.net> which can collect lots of
       status information of a machine and put them in an RRD database
       using pretty less ressources.

       So it's really nice but I need more because I'd like to have
       all those RRD files centralized on one machine in real
       time. Yeah, you might answer that I can tell rrd- collect to
       write on a remote filesystem, but it's quite more intrusive,
       especially if you tell rrdcollect to update states each 5
       seconds. So the idea of using the rrdcollect ability to print
       RRD commands on the standard output comes to me (to a friend
       actually :).

       So there it is, rrdcollect-remote start an rrdcollect process
       throught SSH on sev- eral machine and pipe their output in a
       single rrdtool process. Thus, a single rrd- tool process
       updates lot of RRD files for lot of machines.

       Additinally I needed an automatic way to create new RRD files
       when needed. So rrd- collect-remote can search for the rrd
       create command in the remote rrdcollect con- figuration file
       and create it automagically.
