Description: Collect rrdcollect output from several hosts to update local RRD files
 rrdcollect-remote is a Perl daemon that uses the rrdcollect ability
 to print RRD updates commands to its standard output to do updates
 from a remote machine using a persistent RSH or SSH connection. Thus
 you can centralize rrdcollect outputs of several hosts on a single
 repository with no need for complex and intrusive file-sharing
 protocols like NFS or CPU-intensive and inefficiant periodic polling
 like SNMP and so on.
